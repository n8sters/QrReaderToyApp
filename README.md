# QrReaderToyApp

A toy app for simple QR reading. Stripped down from the Google Mobile Vision Tutorial.

I wanted a simple QR reader for my current contract app. For my purposes SIMPLICITY was key, so this is about as clean as I could make the helper classes without sacrificing functionality. 

Many thanks to the great people @ Varvet for their great tutorial, on which this project is heavily based.
